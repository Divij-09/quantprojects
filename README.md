Excel Insights Automation Toolkit
This project is an extended initiative I took on during my internship to streamline data analysis and reporting tasks directly in Excel. The toolkit uses Python to automate data processing, create insightful visualizations, and embed them back into Excel files—saving time and effort for teams working with large datasets.
What It Does:
Pie Chart Visualization: Automatically aggregates data (e.g., "Yes," "No," "Maybe" responses) from multiple sheets and creates a pie chart to highlight trends. The chart is embedded directly in the workbook for easy sharing.

Bar Chart Creation: Summarizes task assignments (like who is responsible for what) and generates bar charts for a clear, visual breakdown.

Custom Summary Tables: Pulls data from all sheets to create well-organized, formatted tables with counts for unique values (including blanks) and places them in a designated spot within the workbook.

Excel Integration: Uses OpenPyXL to seamlessly add charts and tables to a "Summary" sheet, keeping everything in one place without disrupting the original data.

Why It Matters:
This toolkit isn’t just about automating repetitive tasks—it helps uncover patterns and insights quickly. While initially developed to support operational workflows during my internship, the code can easily be adapted for financial analysis projects. For example:

Summarizing budget categories or expenses across departments.
Visualizing investment performance or risk metrics.
Automating the preparation of dashboards for decision-makers.
By combining Python's data processing power with Excel’s familiarity, this project bridges the gap between technical insights and everyday business tools.
